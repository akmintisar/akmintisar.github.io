About Me
==
Hello! I'm Intisar, currently pursuing my Master's in Computational & Quantitative Methods with a focus on Applied Mathematics at Lamar University, Texas. My academic journey and professional interests are deeply rooted in the analysis of large data sets, trend generation, and data-driven decision-making, particularly within the realms of mathematics, statistics, and finance.

With a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh, I have a solid foundation in engineering principles, which complements my current studies in applied mathematics. My background equips me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and analytical thinking, essential for tackling complex data challenges.

On this website, you'll find insights into my academic projects, research interests, and professional aspirations. Whether you're here to collaborate, explore my work, or share ideas, I hope you find something of value.
